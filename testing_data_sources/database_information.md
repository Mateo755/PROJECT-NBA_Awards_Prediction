## ðŸ“‚ Database Information

The project uses a large SQLite database (`nba_kaggle.sqlite`) containing player and team statistics from multiple NBA seasons.

Because this file exceeds GitHubâ€™s 100MB upload limit, it is **not included in the repository**.  
You must download it manually from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball) and place it in the following folder:

```bash
/databases/nba_kaggle.sqlite
